# Qippy

Qippy is a Quantum Circuit simulator!

Under development...

Published to reserve the namespace.

## Roadmap

- Symbolic parser (for better root evaluation...)
- 5 Qubit simulations
- Common Statevectors
  - |0>, |1>
  - |+>, |->
  - Y-Basis
- Probability calculations
- Bloch Sphere implementation
- Basic 1-qubit Gates:
  - Pauli-{X, Y, Z}
  - Hadamard
  - Identity
  - Phase
  - S, T Gates
  - U-Gate
- Basic multi-qubit Gates:
  - CNOT / XOR
  - Toffoli / AND
  - More...
- Gate Builder
- Statevector Builder
